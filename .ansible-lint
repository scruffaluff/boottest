  # Variable names in package/defaults/main.yaml and variable/defaults/main.yaml
  # are chosen for user convenience. Since disabling an Ansible lint rule for an
  # entire file still gives a warning as specified at
  # https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/configuring/#ignoring-rules-for-entire-files,
  # the variable naming rule is disabled. Maintainers should occasionally check
  # variable naming is consistent for all other files by commenting the next
  # line.
